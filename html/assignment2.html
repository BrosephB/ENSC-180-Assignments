What can we say about the density of air in the stratosphere?     How is the density of air different at around 39,000 meters than it     is on the ground? The density of air near the top of the strtosphere is nearly zero. Here is our source: <a href="http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/SEES/ozone/class/Chap_6/6_2.htm#:~:text=The%20density%20of%20air%20near,with%20altitude%20and%20then%20increases">http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/SEES/ozone/class/Chap_6/6_2.htm#:~:text=The%20density%20of%20air%20near,with%20altitude%20and%20then%20increases</a>. The density of air compared to the ground it close to 1.2 Felix needs to wear his own helmet with oxyge and pressure suit since there is a lack of atomosphere pressure and air which will allow him to die. There was a higher velocity at the higher stratosphere point, therefore Felix has a lower drag froce at 39000m.

%% Part 1
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% How accurate is the model for the first portion of the minute? 
% The height vs the height measured is quite similar, in fact they are
% almost identical to eachother for the first portion of the minute. We can
% also state the same for velocity, as they are almost identical again.
% However, the measured acceleration changes quite frequently but remains
% similar to the modelled acceleration. Therfore, all of models are quite
% similar to eachother for the first portion of the minute.

% How accurate is the model for the last portion of that first minute? 
% The three models seems to differ at the start of the last portion of the

% and you can see a difference between the modelled and measured values.

%    changes in the chosen mass?
% If we changed the mass to 116kg or 120kg in order to consider the chances
% of calculation error, we noticed that changing mass values leads to
% change in terminal velocity. (Shift up or down)

%% Part 3
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% Felix was wearing a pressure suit and carrying oxygen. Why? 
%     What can we say about the density of air in the stratosphere?
%     How is the density of air different at around 39,000 meters than it 
%     is on the ground?
% The density of air near the top of the strtosphere is nearly zero. Here
% is our source: http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/SEES/ozone/class/Chap_6/6_2.htm#:~:text=The%20density%20of%20air%20near,with%20altitude%20and%20then%20increases.
% The density of air compared to the ground it close to 1.2
% Felix needs to wear his own helmet with oxyge and pressure suit since
% there is a lack of atomosphere pressure and air which will allow him to
% die.
% There was a higher velocity at the higher stratosphere point, therefore
% Felix has a lower drag froce at 39000m. Therefore, we can conclude that
% the lower the altitude, the higher the density of air.


% What are the factors involved in calculating the density of air? 
%     How do those factors change when we end up at the ground but start 
%     at the stratosphere?  Please explain how calculating air density up 
%     to the stratosphere is more complicated than say just in the troposphere.
% After research, the factors thaat involve calculating the density of air
% wa mainly pressure, temperature, and humidity. The air density formula
% includes, density of air, absolute pressure, specific gas constant, and
% absolute temperature. 
% According to online researh, as we get closer to the ground, the values tend to converge towards one.
% What method(s) can we employ to estimate [the ACd] product? 

% What is your estimated [ACd] product?
% ACd = 0.889
%
% [Given what we are told in the textbook about the simple drag constant, b,] 
%   does the estimate for ACd seem reasonable?
% We do not believe the estimate is reasonable.

%% Part 4
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% What is the actual gravitational field strength around 39,000 meters? 
%   (See Tipler Volume 1 6e page 369.) 
%  9.688m/s^2 is the acceleration due to gravity at 39000m 
% How sensitive is the altitude reached after 4.5 minutes to simpler and 
%   more complicated ways of modelling the gravitational field strength? 
% The altitude is not very sensitive because using the formula grav =
% g_SEA*(r_earth^2)./(r_earth+y).^2 our value with 9.8 is already very
% close to one. Therefore, a change will not make a big difference.

% What other changes could we make to our model? Refer to, or at least 
%   attempt to explain, the physics behind any changes that you propose. 
% We could find much more accurate data, this will allow use to have a
% smoother graph without any gaps in between.

% What is a change that we could make to our model that would result in 
%   insignificant changes to the altitude reached after 4.5 minutes? 
% Any changes we make will allow the current data to change, therefore the
% results will be different.
% How can we decide what change is significant and what change is 
%   insignificant?
% We can calculate error %, if there is a larger % of error, than it is a
% significant change.

% [What changes did you try out to improve the model?  (Show us your changes
%   even if they didn't make the improvement you hoped for.)]
% We tried to make the excel data a bit better, however it was quite hard,
% it filled in some of the gaps was had initially.

%% Part 5
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% At what altitude does Felix pull the ripcord to deploy his parachute? 
% About 2517 m, we looked when there was a big impact on velocity

% Recalculate the CdA product with the parachute open, and modify your 
%   code so that you use one CdA product before and one after this altitude. 
%   According to this version of the model, what is the maximum magnitude 
%   of acceleration that Felix experiences? 
% <put your answer here in these comments>

%   How safe or unsafe would such an acceleration be for Felix?
% It would be extremely unsafe as the brain is deprived of oxygen. Felix's
% flesh would break due to stress, too much force.

part = 5;

%Make a single acceleration-plot figure that includes, for each of the 
%model and the acceleration calculated from measurements, the moment when 
%the parachute opens and the following 10 or so seconds. If you have 
%trouble solving this version of the model, just plot the acceleration 
%calculated from measurements.
